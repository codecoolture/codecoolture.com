# Effective Code Reviews

Many companies use pull requests as a critical part of their software
development process to achieve goals such as automated testing (via continuous
integration services) and conducting code reviews.

In many cases, pull requests also serve as gatekeepers to production: someone
from the organization (likely from the same team) needs to approve the changes
for development to move forward. This process is often a source of frustration
in software teams, where it is common to hear complaints about how long it takes
for a pull request to be reviewed or the lack of constructive feedback received
during code reviews.

On the other hand, reviewers often express frustration because pull requests are
usually very large, making them difficult to review and thus more
time-consuming. Still, many developers write code with a focus on their own
productivity instead of optimizing for the later, required step of code
reviewing.

In this series, I'd like to explore ways to make code reviews more productive
for everyone: developers who want to receive constructive feedback while
releasing software on time, and code reviewers who want to set a high-quality
standard and use code reviews as a tool to leverage collective learning and
knowledge sharing.

## But first...

Pull requests, or pull request-based workflows, are just one option for
collaborative work. I'm aware that other teams use more lightweight approaches,
such as [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), where all
commits are made directly to the main branch. This method relies on a highly
sophisticated continuous integration infrastructure to validate each commit
before it gets released.

There are also companies that focus heavily on pair or ensemble programming
sessions, thereby reducing the need for asynchronous work. Still, highly
distributed companies or teams that prefer a more asynchronous approach may
choose pull requests to review code.

Ultimately, this series is not advocating for a pull request workflow but rather
highlighting ways to make it more productive.
